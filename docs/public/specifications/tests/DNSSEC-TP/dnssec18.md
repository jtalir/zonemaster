# DNSSEC18: Validate trust from DS to CDS and CDNSKEY

## Test case identifier
**DNSSEC18**

## Objective

CDS and CDNSKEY record types are defined in [RFC 7344] and [RFC 8078]. Both
record types are optional in a zone. The objective of this test case is to verify
that there is a correct chain of trust from DS, in the parent zone to the CDS and
CDNSKEY RRsets ([RFC 7344][RFC 7344#4.1], section 4.1).

As stated in [RFC 4035][RFC 4035#2.4], section 2.4:
> A DS RR SHOULD point to a DNSKEY RR that is present in the child's
> apex DNSKEY RRset, and the child's apex DNSKEY RRset SHOULD be
> signed by the corresponding private key."

This Test case is only relevant if 
* The *Child Zone* has either CDS or CDNSKEY record or both, and
* The parent zone has a DS RRset for the *Child Zone*.

## Scope

It is assumed that *Child Zone* is also tested by [Connectivity01]. This test
case will just ignore non-responsive name servers or name servers not
giving a correct DNS response for an authoritative name server.

It is assumed that *Child Zone* has been tested or will be tested by
[DNSSEC15], [DNSSEC16] and [DNSSEC17] and that the servers give the
same responses. Running this test case without running [DNSSEC15],
[DNSSEC16] and [DNSSEC17] can give an incomplete report of the CDS and
CDNSKEY status of *Child Zone*.

## Summary

* If no CDS or CDNSKEY records are found, this test case is not run
  and no message will be outputted.
* If no DS records are found at parent, this test case is not run
  and no message will be outputted.

Message Tag outputted          | [Default level] | Description of when message tag is outputted
:------------------------------|:------|:-----------------------------------------
DS18_NO_MATCH_CDS_RRSIG_DS     | ERROR | The CDS RRset is not signed with a DNSKEY record that a DS record points to.
DS18_NO_MATCH_CDNSKEY_RRSIG_DS | ERROR | CDNSKEY RRset is not signed with a DNSKEY record that a DS record points to.

## Inputs

* "Child Zone" - The domain name to be tested.
* "Test Type" - The test type with value "undelegated" or "normal".
* "Undelegated DS" - The DS record or records submitted (only if
  Test Type is undelegated).

## Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1.  Create a CDS query with EDNS enabled and the DO bit set for the
    apex of the *Child Zone*.

2.  Create a CDNSKEY query with EDNS enabled and the DO bit set for
    the apex of the *Child Zone*.

3.  Create a DNSKEY query with EDNS enabled and the DO bit set for
    the apex of the *Child Zone*.

4.  Create a DS query with EDNS enabled and DO flag set for the name of
    the *Child Zone*.

5.  Create the following empty sets:
    1.  Name server IP address and associated CDS RRset and its RRSIG
        records ("CDS RRsets"). A name server IP can hold an empty 
        RRset or no RRSIG records.
    2.  Name server IP address and associated CDNSKEY RRset and its
        RRSIG records ("CDNSKEY RRsets"). A name server IP can hold an
        empty RRset or no RRSIG records.
    3.  Name server IP address and associated DNSKEY RRset
        ("DNSKEY RRsets"). A name server IP can hold an empty RRset.
    4.  DS record set ("DS Records").
    5.  Name server IP ("DS No Match CDS RRSIG").
    6.  Name server IP ("DS No Match CDNSKEY RRSIG").

6. If the *Test Type* is "undelegated, then:
   1. Add *Undelegated DS* set to *DS Records*.

7. Else, do (*Test Type* is "normal"):
   1. Retrieve all name server IP addresses for the parent zone of
      *Child Zone* using Get-Parent-NS-IP ("Parent NS IP").
   2. For each IP address in *Parent NS IP* do:
      1. Send the DS query over UDP to the name server IP.
      2. If no DNS response is returned, then go to next name server
         IP.
      3. Else, if AA bit is not set in the DNS response, then go to
         next name server IP.
      3. Else, if the RCODE in the DNS response is not *NOERROR*, then
         go to next name server IP.
      4. Else, if the DNS response contains at least one DS record
         add all DS records to *DS Records*.

8. If *DS Records* is empty, terminate this test case.

9.  Retrieve all name server IP addresses for the *Child Zone* using
    [Method4] and [Method5] ("NS IP").

10. Repeat the following steps for each name server IP address in 
    *NS IP*:

    1. Send the CDS query over UDP to the name server IP address.
       1. If no DNS response is returned, then go to next name server 
          IP.
       2. Else, if AA bit is not set in the DNS response, then go to
          next name server IP.
       3. Else, if the RCODE in the DNS response is not *NOERROR*, then
          go to next name server IP.
       4. Else, if the DNS response contains at least one CDS record
          in the answer section, then add the name server IP and the
          CDS RRset to the *CDS RRsets* set. Also include any associated
          RRSIG records.
    2. Send the CDNSKEY query over UDP to the name server IP address.
       1. If no DNS response is returned, then go to next name server
          IP.
       2. Else, if AA bit is not set in the DNS response, then go to
          next name server IP.
       3. Else, if the RCODE in the DNS response is not *NOERROR*, then
          go to next name server IP.
       4. Else, if the DNS response contains at least one CDNSKEY
          record in the answer section, then add the name server IP and
          the CDNSKEY RRset from the answer section to the 
          *CDNSKEY RRsets* set. Also include any associated RRSIG records.
    3. Send the DNSKEY query over UDP to the name server IP address.
       1. If no DNS response is returned, then go to next name server
          IP.
       2. Else, if AA bit is not set in the DNS response, then go to
          next name server IP.
       3. Else, if the RCODE in the DNS response is not *NOERROR*, then
          go to next name server IP.
       4. Else, if the DNS response contains at least one DNSKEY
          record in the answer section, then add the name server IP and
          the DNSKEY RRset from the answer section to the 
          *DNSKEY RRsets* set.
    4. Go to next name server IP.

11. If both the *CDS RRsets* and *CDNSKEY RRsets* sets are empty, then
    terminate this test case.

12. If the *DNSKEY RRsets* is empty, then terminate this test case.

13. For each name server IP in the *CDS RRsets* set do:

    1. Extract the RRSIG records for the CDS RRset.
    2. Extract the DNSKEY from the *DNSKEY RRsets* for the same name
       server IP.
    3. For each DS record in *DS Records* do:
       1. If the DS record does not point to a DNSKEY record then go
          to next DS record.
       2. Else, if the DNSKEY that the DS record points to matches
          an RRSIG for CDS RRset then go to next name server IP
          address.
       3. Go to next DS records.
    4. Add name server IP to the *DS No Match CDS RRSIG* (i.e. there was no match
       between any DS record and an RRSIG record for the CDS RRset in the DS
       record loop above).
    5. Go to next name server IP address.

14. For each name server IP in the *CDNSKEY RRsets* set do:

    1. Extract the RRSIG records for the CDNSKEY RRset.
    2. Extract the DNSKEY from the *DNSKEY RRsets* for the same name
       server IP.
    3. For each DS record in *DS Records* do:
       1. If the DS record does not point to a DNSKEY record then go
          to next DS record.
       2. Else, if the DNSKEY that the DS record points to matches
          an RRSIG for CDNSKEY RRset then go to next name server IP
          address.
       3. Go to next DS records.
    4. Add name server IP to the *DS No Match CDNSKEY RRSIG* (i.e. there was no match
       between any DS record and an RRSIG record for the CDNSKEY RRset in the DS
       record loop above).
    5. Go to next name server IP address.

15. If the *DS No Match CDS RRSIG* set is non-empty then output
    *[DS18_NO_MATCH_CDS_RRSIG_DS]* with the name server IP addresses in
    the set.

16. If the *DS No Match CDNSKEY RRSIG* set is non-empty then output 
    *[DS18_NO_MATCH_CDNSKEY_RRSIG_DS]* with the name server IP
    addresses in the set.

## Outcome(s)

The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *[ERROR]* or *[CRITICAL]*.

The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *[WARNING]*, but no message with severity level
*ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

In other cases, no message or only messages with severity level
*[INFO]* or *[NOTICE]*, the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

## Special procedural requirements

If either IPv4 or IPv6 transport is disabled, ignore the evaluation of the
result of any test using this transport protocol. Log a message reporting
the ignored protocol.
