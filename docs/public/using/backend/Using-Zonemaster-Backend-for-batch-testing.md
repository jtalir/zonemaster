## Introduction

In [Using the Backend JSON-RPC API] it is shown how a test of a single domain name
(zone) can be started using the JSON-RPC API to Zonemaster-Backend. It is also
possible to start a batch of domain names at the same time. In principle such
a batch is the same thing as running the `start_domain_test` individually for each
domain name in the batch.

This document describes how batches of domain name tests can be run and what
to think about when running batches, especially large ones.

Zonemaster-Backend uses a database to store enqueued tests and
results from tests. It is possible to use SQLite as the database backend for
small installations and test installations, but that is not appropriate for running
real batches on. Therefore in this document it is assumed that Backend has been
installed with [MariaDB/MySQL] or [PostgreSQL].

## Combining GUI and batch

Both GUI and batch uses Zonemaster-Backend that stores the data in the database.
If the same database is used, then all tests run, regardless if they are
started via GUI or a batch, will be available in the GUI interface
using the `get_test_history` (see relevant section in
[Using the Backend JSON-RPC API][Using#find-previous-tests]). Depending on the
situation, running batches on the same Backend as GUI may be desirable or not
recommended. If the results are expected to be available through GUI then the batches must be
run on the same Backend. If the batches are run with a reduced set of test cases
then it can be confusing since the results are not fully comparable with
those from tests started from GUI. If the results from batch tests should not be
mixed with tests from normal GUI tests, a separate installation of Backend is
required, and that might not need any GUI at all.

Test prioritization is another aspect of mixing tests from batches and GUI on the same Backend. By default Backend will run
tests from GUI (or rather by `start_domain_test`) before test from a batch. In
this way interactive GUI users run tests do not have to wait for a
batch to complete. A large batch might run for days.

## Configuration to run batches

To start a batch job, setting `enable_add_batch_job` in [backend_config.ini] must
be enabled (*enabled* by default). Moreover a special user must also be available.
To create that user setting `enable_add_api_user` must be enabled
(*disabled* by default). (See below for how to create the user.) Note that this setting
only needs to be enabled while creating the user(s), not when starting a batch job.

After changing these settings, the JSON-RPC API service (running as a daemon)
must be restarted.

It is not recommended to enable `enable_add_api_user` for an JSON-RPC API service
that can be used by untrusted users, e.g. via GUI. If the installation for the
batch jobs is a dedicated installation, then it is not an issue. If it is used by
a public GUI that could be closed while the batch user or users are created, then
that could be an option. Creating the user only takes as long time as it takes to
type the command in, i.e. seconds.

Another option is to set up an additional JSON-RPC API service using the same
database. Zonemaster-Backend can have several parallel JSON-RPC API services with
different configuration, see [Appendix: Add more JSON-RPC API services].

## Create batch user

The [Using the Backend JSON-RPC API] guide shows how `zmb` can be used for
several JSON-RPC API methods. It can also be used for the creation of the batch
user. It is here assumed that `enable_add_api_user` has been enabled or else the
following will be included  in the response to the `zmb add_api_user` command:
```
"message": "Procedure 'add_api_user' not found"
```

Run `zmb add_api_user --username myuser --api-key mykey | jq` where `myuser` is
a user name of your choice and `mykey` the password, which should probably be
longer and more complex. The output is simply

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 1,
  "id": 1
}
```

Now `enable_add_api_user` can be disabled.

## Run a batch job

The `zmb` tool is used for that purpose. A batch job can be started with just a few
domain names or a list of millions of domain names.

### Start a batch job

Batches are created using `add_batch_job`:

```
$ zmb add_batch_job --username myuser --api-key mykey --domain zonemaster.net --domain zonemaster.se --domain zonemaster.fr | jq
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 2,
  "id": 1
}
```

Options that are mandatory are `--username`, `--api-key` and `--domain`. Option
`--domain` is repeated for every domain name in the batch. The other options are
optional. For all options see `zmb man`.

The batch ID is found in "result", which is "2" in this case.

Listing the domain names one by one is however cumbersome unless it is a very
small batch as above. A better alternative for a larger batch is to create text
file of the domain names to test, one domain name per line. Comments starting
with `#` is permitted, which makes it possible to add meta information to the
file.

```
cat batchfile.txt
# Example batch
zonemaster.net
zonemaster.se
zonemaster.fr
```

Now we can run the same batch as above, but from the file:

```
$ zmb add_batch_job --username myuser --api-key mykey --file batchfile | jq
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 3,
  "id": 1
}
```

Starting the batch with the domain names one by one or in the file gives exactly
the same result. Also in this case, IDN domain names can be entered both with
A-label and U-label (UTF-8 is assumed).

### Status of a batch job

To check the status of a batch job the batch ID is required ("2" in the
case above), using `get_batch_job_result`:

```
$ zmb get_batch_job_result --batch-id 2 | jq
{
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "nb_running": 3,
    "nb_finished": 0
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

Three tests are running, none has been completed yet. After some time running the
command again gives:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "nb_running": 0,
    "finished_test_ids": [
      "b26b874493ed4b57",
      "9af528070fa2551a",
      "708f82b5176261dc"
    ],
    "nb_finished": 3
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

Now all tests in the batch are completed. The test IDs in `finished_test_ids`
can be used to get the results with `get_test_results`.

## Scale out

Running a batch can take a long time and if that is a problem then it is possible
to increase the performance by:

* Enabling global cache
* Increasing `number_of_processes_for_batch_testing`
* Adding one or more Test Agent service
* Adding one or more test servers

### Enable global cache

For each domain name in a batch job, a test run is executed.
Each test run keeps its own cache to avoid sending the same query twice.
However these caches are never shared between test runs.
This may result in large numbers of redundant queries for large batches where
the domain name directly (or indirectly) share data with other domain names.
To share responses between test runs, you can enable the global cache feature
which works like a second level cache.

For interactive tests via GUI the global cache is probably not desired. If a user
changes the DNS configuration of a domain then the following tests results should
not be based on old data.

To enable global cache a custom profile must be used. See the instructions in
[Configuration: Global cache in Zonemaster-Engine][Global-cache].

The custom profile is assumed to be `/etc/zonemaster/profile-batch.json`
(Linux) or `/etc/local/zonemaster/profile-batch.json` (FreeBSD).

The custom profile file, say `profile-batch.json`, must be added to the Backend
configuration to be made available for the tests. In `backend_config.ini` look
for the section `[PRIVATE PROFILES]`. Under that add the following line for
Linux:

```
batch=/etc/zonemaster/profile-batch.json
```

For FreeBSD add:

```
batch=/usr/local/etc/zonemaster/profile-batch.json
```

After updating the Backend configuration, restart both JSON-RPC API service and
Test Agent service (all daemons of both services if there are more than one of
each).

Now you can start a batch -- using the same batch file as above -- with:

```
$ zmb add_batch_job --profile batch --username myuser --api-key mykey --file batchfile | jq
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 4,
  "id": 1
}
```

### Increase the worker pool size

A standard Backend installation has a single Test Agent service. Each Test Agent
service maintains a pool of workers. Test Agents monitor the Backend database for
tests and assigns them to workers.

Increasing the size of the worker pool can improve the testing performance. The
improvement is limited by CPU, I/O, memory and the ability of the Test Agent
service to keep its workers busy, so monitor these factors to find the best
configuration.

To adjust the worker pool size, set `number_of_processes_for_batch_testing` in
the [backend_config.ini] configuration file.

### Add more Test Agent services

If the increase of `number_of_processes_for_batch_testing` does not help anymore
and the server has free resources (IO, CPU and RAM) then adding another Test
Agent services (with its pool of workers) can help.

The default Test Agent service is started by the start script
`/etc/systemd/system/zm-testagent.service` (Rocky Linux),
`/etc/init.d/zm-testagent` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zm_testagent`
(FreeBSD). Create a copy so that the additional Test Agent service has a new
name, new PID file and new log file. Also see the
[Backend installation instructions]. Each Test Agent service will be its own
daemon.

Start the new daemon and now a second Test Agent service is running.
Additional Test Agent services can be added by repeating the steps above.

Unless the different Test Agent services should process different
[queues](#queues) the same configuration file can be used.

### Add more test servers

Adding more servers is a generalization of adding more Test Agent daemons.

* Configure the database to listen on an external interface. The database can
  also be moved to a dedicated server.
* Install Backend on the new Test Agent server, but disable JSON-RPC API service. 
* Update configuration to use the external database server.
* Consider adding more Test Agent services.
* If global cache is used, configure Redis to listen on an external interface.
  The Redis server can also be moved to a dedicated server.
* Consider moving JSON-RPC API service to a dedicated server. If so, update the
  configuration to use the external database server.
* If applicable, configure all parts to use external database server and external
  Redis server.

## Queues

Every enqueued test has a [queue tag][JSON-RPC API#queue]. In the
[configuration][Config#lock_on_queue] file it is set which queue should be
processed by the Test Agent service. Only tests with matching queue value
(default 0) will be processed. Queue tag is set by the JSON-RPC API methods
`start_domain_test` and `add_batch_job`, respectively (default 0 in both cases).

If desirable it is possible to create a batch with another queue value and then
let a dedicated Test Agent service, possibly on a dedicated server, process the
tests in the batch, while another Test Agent service processes tests from GUI.

It is important to note that if a test is tagged with a queue value that no
Test Agent service uses it will never be processed.

In the end, all completed tests will end up in the same database and will be
mixed when looking for completed tests for the same domain name
(`get_test_history`).

## Appendix: Add more JSON-RPC API services

The JSON-RPC API service listens by default on 127.0.0.1 on port 5000. That is
governed by the start script for the JSON-RPC API service which is
`/etc/systemd/system/zm-rpcapi.service` (Rocky Linux), `/etc/init.d/zm-rpcapi`
(Ubuntu and Debian) or `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zm_rpcapi` (FreeBSD). Create a copy
so that the additional service (daemon) has a new name, new PID file, new log
file and listens to a new port. Also see the [Backend installation instructions].

Start the new daemon and now a second JSON-RPC API service is running.

To be useful, the second JSON-RPC API service should probably have a different
configuration file too. The configuration file is found as
`/etc/zonemaster/backend_config.ini` (Linux) or as
`/usr/local/etc/zonemaster/backend_config.ini` (FreeBSD). The database settings
must not be changed, or else the two JSON-RPC API services will not be part of
the same Zonemaster Backend. Examples of settings that could be different between
the two JSON-RPC API services are:

* enable_add_api_user
* Available profiles

Restart the JSON-RPC API services to use the updated configuration files.
