## CONFIGURATION04: Delegation Inconsistency - Name Server Records 

### Test case identifier

**CONFIGURATION04:** Delegation Inconsistency - Name Server Records

### Objective 

When a parent zone 'P' delegates part of its namespace to a child 'C', P stores
the list of NS records for the authoritative servers of zone 'C'. This list of
NS records are kept both at the parent 'P' and the child zone 'C'. 

Delegation inconsistency occurs when changes at the 'C' are not reflected to the NS RRs
at 'P'.

### Inputs

The domain to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Configure a live zone with inconsistency in name server records between parent
and child.

```
configuration04-1.zft-root.rd.nic.fr
```

2. The engine should return FAIL at least once for the configuration defined. If it
returns PASS for all the tests then the engine does not capture delegation
inconsistency in name server records.

### Results
Verifying the zone with zonemaster CLI does provide conclusive errors as
you could see from the appendix
