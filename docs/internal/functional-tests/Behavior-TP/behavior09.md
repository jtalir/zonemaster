## BEHAVIOR09: Appropriate error code when the zone is misconfigured

### Test case identifier

**BEHAVIOR09:** Appropriate error code when the zone is misconfigured

### Objective 

The objective of this test is to verify that the engine catches the zone
mis-configurations appropriately

### Inputs

The broken domain to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. A standard query for the domain is made using the zonemaster CLI
2. If the output from the CLI does not catch the expected errors, then the test
returns FAIL

### Results
Even though exhaustive tests are not run, for the tests being run the engine
seems to capture the errors.
